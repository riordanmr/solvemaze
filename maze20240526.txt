# 2024-07-01  There's a maze in the 2024-05-26 issue of NYT. 
# I thought it would be interesting to write a Go program to solve it.  
# I'm gathering a description of the maze here.
# I am describing only those nodes in the maze where you have a choice 
# of which way to go. Each such node will have a number, and each node 
# will have letters describing the choices. So far, it looks as if each 
# node in the maze has only two choices, so the directions to go will be
#  "a" and "b". I have written on the paper maze itself which is a and b. 
#
# Below I have written notation which describes what happens when you go a certain way in the maze. 
# 1a 2  means that if you start at node 1 and take direction a, you get to node 2.
# 1b x  means that if you start at node 1 and take direction b, you eventually reach a dead end.
# 2a e  means that if you start at node 2 and take direction a, you will reach the end.
